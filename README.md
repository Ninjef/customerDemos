Open `DocumentationStyle1.md` and `DocumentationStyle2.md` for examples of this codebase documented by AI in different ways. These are very rough drafts, and can be modified and improved in numerous ways depending on your preferences.

PlantUML diagrams can also be generated. This requires a little more setup for me to ensure the AI gets them right. I will provide examples of these if the documentation piques your interest.
